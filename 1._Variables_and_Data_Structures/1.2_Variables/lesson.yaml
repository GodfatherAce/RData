- {AnswerTests: 'omnitest(correctExpr=''v1 = c(2, 9, 3, 4.5)'')', Class: cmd_question,
  CorrectAnswer: 'v1 = c(2, 9, 3, 4.5)', Hint: 'Use the "c" function to construct
    a vector, and make sure you assign it to "v1"', Output: 'Create a vector called
    "v1" containing four values, in this order- 2, 9, 3, 4.5.'}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='length(v1)'), Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: length(v1),
  Hint: Use the "length" function, Output: Find the length of v1}
- {AnswerTests: 'omnitest(correctExpr=''v2 = c(15, 4, 8, 10)'')', Class: cmd_question,
  CorrectAnswer: 'v2 = c(15, 4, 8, 10)', Hint: 'Use the "c" function to construct
    a vector, and make sure you assign it to "v2"', Output: 'Create a vector called
    "v2" containing four values, in this order- 15, 4, 8, 10'}
- {AnswerTests: 'omnitest(correctExpr=''v3 = c(v1, v2)'')', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'v3
    = c(v1, v2)', Hint: Use the "c" function to combine vectors, Output: 'Combine
    the v1 and v2 vectors into one vector of length 8, assigning the result to v3'}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(v3)'), Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: mean(v3),
  Hint: Use the "mean" function, Output: Find the mean of v3}
- {AnswerTests: 'omnitest(correctExpr=''v3[3]'')', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'v3[3]',
  Hint: Use square brackets to extract a value from a vector, Output: Extract the
    third value from v3}
