- {AnswerChoices: someVariable;some-variable;some.variable;some_variable, AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="some-variable"),
  Class: mult_question, CorrectAnswer: some-variable, Hint: 'Variable names in R can
    contain uppercase or lowercase letters, digits (except at the start of the variable),
    periods, or underscores', Output: 'Which of the following is *not* a permitted
    variable name in R?'}
- {AnswerTests: 'any_of_exprs(''mynum = 200'', ''mynum <- 200'')', Class: cmd_question,
  CorrectAnswer: mynum = 200, Hint: 'Use the assignment operator, "="', Output: Create
    a variable called mynum with the value 200.}
- {AnswerTests: expr_creates_var("mychar") && (mychar == "hello world"), Class: cmd_question,
  CorrectAnswer: mychar = "hello world", Hint: 'Use the assignment operator, "=",
    and don''t forget to surround the words with quotes', Output: Create a character
    variable called mychar that contains the words "hello world"}
- {AnswerTests: 'any_of_exprs(''mynum2 = mynum + 20'', ''mynum2 <- mynum + 20'')',
  Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: mynum2 = mynum + 20, Hint: 'Use the assignment
    operator, "=", and on the right hand side put the expression you want to calculate',
  Output: 'Add 20 to your "mynum" variable and save it to a new variable, "mynum2"'}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='300 / 90'), Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 300
    / 90, Hint: Use "/" for division, Output: Use R to calculate 300 divided by 90
    (you do not have to save it to a variable)}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='8^4'), Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 8^4,
  Hint: Use "^" for exponentiation, Output: Use R to calculate 8 to the power of 4
    (you do not have to save it to a variable)}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='log(15)'), Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: log(15),
  Hint: 'To call a function (e.g. func), you put the name of the function then parentheses
    containing the value you are performing it on, (e.g. func(x))', Output: Use the
    "log" function to compute the natural logarithm of 15}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cos(15)'), Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: cos(15),
  Hint: 'To call a function (e.g. "func"), you put the name of the function then parentheses
    containing the value you are performing it on, (e.g. "func(x)")', Output: The
    function "cos" computes the trigonometric cosine of a number. Use this function
    to compute the cosine of 15.}
