            Output: Each subject in the french_fries dataset was queried about five flavors ("potato", "buttery", "grassy", "rancid", "painty"). Currently, each flavor the subjects were asked about is a separate column.
          
          - Class: cmd_question
            Output: Create a boxplot comparing the "buttery" rating between each of the three oils (oil is denoted by the "treatment" column).

          - Class: cmd_question
            Output: Use reshape2's "melt" function create a new dataset, "french_fries.m", such that each tasting of each flavor has a separate row. There should be one column called "variable" containing the flavor name ("potato", "buttery", etc) and one column called value containing the numeric rating.

            AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='french_fries.m = melt(french_fries, id=c("time", "treatment", "subject", "rep"))')
            Hint: The hard part is getting the "id" argument to melt right. Each column that is not a flavor should be provided as an id since you want to keep it as a column in the melted dataset.
          
          - Class: cmd_question
            Output: Use french_fries.m to a boxplot comparing the taste rating between each of the three treatments (oils), but divide it into faceted subplots based on which flavor (buttery, potato) is being tested.
            CorrectAnswer: ggplot(french_fries.m, aes(treatment, value)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~ variable)
            AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ggplot(french_fries.m, aes(x=treatment, y=value)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~ variable)')
            Hint: Note that you'll be using the "variable" and "value" columns of the melted dataset rather than columns like "potato" or "buttery". Note that this kind of plot was not possible before the data was melted.

            CorrectAnswer: pitchers[order(G), ]
            AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pitchers[order(G), ]')

          - Class: cmd_question
            Output: Summarize the pitching dataset, this time based on each team, calculating two columns- totalBB (the sum of the BB column). Save the result as a variable called "summarized.teams"
            CorrectAnswer: summarized.teams = pitching[, list(totalBB=sum(G)), by="teamID"]
            AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summarized.teams = pitching[, list(totalBB=sum(G)), by="teamID"]')
            Hint: You are summarizing by the teamID. Use list()… between the two parentheses to compute a named column, making sure you are naming it as requested. Make sure you save it to a variable called "summarized.teams"
