- {AnswerTests: 'any_of_exprs(''library("data.table")'', "library(''data.table'')",
    "library(data.table")', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: "library(\u201Cdata.table\u201D\
    )", Hint: Use the "library" function, Output: Load the data.table library.}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pitching = as.data.table(pitching)'), Class: cmd_question,
  CorrectAnswer: pitching = as.data.table(pitching), Hint: Use the "as.data.table"
    function, Output: Turn the variable "pitching" into a data.table (also called
    "pitching")}
- {AnswerTests: 'any_of_exprs("pitching[1:5, ]", "head(pitching, 6)")', Class: cmd_question,
  CorrectAnswer: 'pitching[1:5, ]', Hint: 'This is the same way you would extract
    the first five rows of a data.frame, using square brackets and a comma', Output: Show
    the first five rows of the "pitching" data.table}
- {AnswerTests: 'any_of_exprs("pitching$playerID", "pitching[, playerID]")', Class: cmd_question,
  CorrectAnswer: pitching$playerID, Hint: 'You can do this the same way as you would
    in a data.frame or list, using a $', Output: Extract the "playerID" column of
    the "pitching" data.table}
- {AnswerTests: 'omnitest(correctExpr=''pitching[teamID == "OAK", ]'')', Class: cmd_question,
  CorrectAnswer: 'pitching[teamID == "OAK", ]', Hint: 'You can add a condition to
    filter by using square brackets, by adding the condition before the comma. Make
    sure you use == rather than =.', Output: Filter the "pitching" data.table to include
    only rows where the teamID is "OAK"}
- {AnswerTests: 'omnitest(correctExpr=''pitching[G >= 10, ]'')', Class: cmd_question,
  CorrectAnswer: 'pitching[G >= 10, ]', Hint: 'You can add a condition to filter by
    using square brackets, by adding the condition before the comma.', Output: Filter
    the "pitching" data.table to include only rows where the column G (that's the
    number of games the pitcher played) is greater than or equal to 10.}
- {AnswerChoices: 5;29620;29624;42583, AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="29624"),
  Class: mult_question, CorrectAnswer: 29624, Hint: Look at the right side of the
    output from the last problem- the numbers that are each followed by a colon are
    the row numbers. Check for the largest row number., Output: 'How many rows are
    in this filtered dataset (with ten or more games)?'}
- {AnswerChoices: 'pitching[order(yearID), ]', AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="29624"),
  Class: mult_question, CorrectAnswer: 29624, Hint: 'Use the "order" function, and
    remember that the name of the column is "yearID".', Output: Sort the pitching
    data.table in ascending order by year.}
