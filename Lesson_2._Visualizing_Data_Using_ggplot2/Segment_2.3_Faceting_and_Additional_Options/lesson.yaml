- {AnswerTests: 'expr_uses_func("geom_point"); expr_uses_func("facet_wrap"); aes_matches(x="z",
    y="price");', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=z, y=price))
    + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~ cut)', Hint: Add a facet_wrap option, Output: 'Create
    a scatter plot of the diamonds dataset with z on the x axis and price on the y
    axis, and divide it into facets based on the diamond''s cut'}
- {AnswerTests: 'expr_uses_func("geom_point"); expr_uses_func("facet_grid"); aes_matches(x="z",
    y="price");', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=z, y=price))
    + geom_point() + facet_grid(cut ~ color)', Hint: 'Add a facet_grid option, with
    row ~ column inside.', Output: 'Create a scatter plot of the diamonds dataset
    with z on the x axis and price on the y axis, and divide it into a facetted grid.
    Let rows in the grid represent different cuts, and let each column represent a
    different color'}
- {AnswerTests: 'expr_uses_func("geom_point") && aes_matches(x="z", y="price") &&
    expr_uses_func("ggtitle") && expr_uses_func("ylim")', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'ggplot(diamonds,
    aes(x=z, y=price)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("My Graph") + ylim(0, 10000)', Hint: Extra
    options get added on to the end of a ggplot call just like layers., Output: 'Create
    a scatter plot of the diamonds dataset with z on the x axis and price on the y
    axis. Give it a title of "My Graph", and limit the y axis from 0 to 10000.'}
- {AnswerTests: 'expr_uses_func("geom_point") && aes_matches(x="age", y="circumference")
    && expr_uses_func("facet_wrap")', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'ggplot(Orange,
    aes(x=age, y=circumference)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~ Tree)', Hint: Make
    sure you change the dataset from "diamonds" to "Orange", Output: 'Create a scatter
    plot of the Orange dataset (which you first saw in Quiz 1.2) with age on the x-axis
    and circumference on the y-axis, faceted into five sub-plots based on the tree
    being measured'}
