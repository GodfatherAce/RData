- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(CO2)'), Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: View(CO2),
  Hint: Use the "View" function, Output: View the CO2 dataset (last seen in Quiz 3.3)
    like a spreadsheet.}
- {AnswerTests: 'expr_uses_func("geom_point"); expr_uses_func("scale_x_log10"); aes_matches(x="conc",
    y="uptake", colour="Type")', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'ggplot(CO2,
    aes(x=conc, y=uptake, color=Type)) + geom_point() + scale_x_log10()', Hint: Don't
    forget to add the color=Type aesthetic and the scale_x_log10() layer., Output: 'Use
    ggplot2 to create a scatter plot with conc on the x-axis, uptake on the y-axis,
    where each point is colored according to its Type ("Quebec" vs "Mississippi").
    Put the x-axis on a log scale.'}
- {AnswerChoices: Mississippi;Quebec, AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Quebec"),
  Class: mult_question, CorrectAnswer: Quebec, Hint: 'See which colored points are,
    on average, higher on the graph', Output: 'Based on this graph, does the Quebec
    or Mississippi grass, on average, have a higher CO2 uptake for a given concentration?'}
- {AnswerTests: 'expr_creates_var("mfit") && class(mfit) == "lm" && length(mfit$coefficients)
    == 3 && abs(mfit$coefficients[3] - (-12.65952)) < 1e-3', Class: cmd_question,
  CorrectAnswer: 'mfit = lm(uptake ~ log(conc) + Type, data=CO2)', Hint: 'The formula
    given to lm should have two values on the right side- "log(conc)", and "Type".
    Don''t forget to save it to a variable called "mfit"', Output: Perform a multiple
    linear regression explaining CO2 uptake by both the log of the concentration and
    the Type variable. Save it to a variable called "mfit"}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(mfit)'), Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: summary(mfit),
  Hint: Use the "summary" function, Output: View a summary of this multiple linear
    regression}
- {AnswerTests: 'expr_uses_func("geom_point"); expr_uses_func("scale_x_log10"); aes_matches(x="conc",
    y="uptake", colour="Type", shape="Treatment")', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'ggplot(CO2,
    aes(x=conc, y=uptake, color=Type, shape=Treatment)) + geom_point() + scale_x_log10()',
  Hint: Don't forget to add the pch=Treatment aesthetic and the scale_x_log10() layer.,
  Output: 'Use ggplot2 to create a scatter plot with conc on the x-axis, uptake on
    the y-axis, where each point is colored according to its Type ("Quebec" vs "Mississippi")
    and the shape of each point (the "pch" or "shape" aesthetic) is determined by
    the Treatment ("chilled" vs "nonchilled"). Put the x-axis on a log scale.'}
- {AnswerTests: 'expr_creates_var("mfit2") && class(mfit2) == "lm" && length(mfit2$coefficients)
    == 4 && abs(mfit2$coefficients[4] - (-6.859524)) < 1e-3', Class: cmd_question,
  CorrectAnswer: 'mfit2 = lm(uptake ~ log(conc) + Type + Treatment, data=CO2)', Hint: 'The
    formula given to lm should have three values on the right side- "log(conc)", "Type"
    and "Treatment". Don''t forget to save it to a variable called "mfit2"', Output: Perform
    a multiple linear regression explaining CO2 uptake by the log of the concentration
    and the Type and Treatment variables. Save it to a variable called "mfit2"}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(mfit2)'), Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: summary(mfit2),
  Hint: Use the "summary" function, Output: View a summary of this multiple linear
    regression}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="1.11e-08"), Class: exact_question, CorrectAnswer: 1.11e-08,
  Hint: This can be found in the row of the coefficients table starting with "Treatmentchilled"-
    this means the effect of a plant being chilled as opposed to being nonchilled.,
  Output: 'What is the p-value of the "Treatment" variable in this regression?'}
- {AnswerChoices: Quebec+chilled;Quebec+nonchilled;Mississippi+chilled;Mississippi+nonchilled,
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Mississippi+chilled"), Class: mult_question, CorrectAnswer: Mississippi+chilled,
  Hint: 'See which combination of color and shape are, on average, lowest on the graph',
  Output: 'Based on this graph, what combination of treatment and type leads to the
    lowest CO2 uptake?'}
