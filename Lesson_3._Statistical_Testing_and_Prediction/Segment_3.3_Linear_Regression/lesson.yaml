- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(CO2)'), Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: View(CO2),
  Hint: Use the "View" function, Output: View the CO2 dataset (seen in Quiz 3.1) like
    a spreadsheet.}
- {AnswerTests: 'expr_uses_func("geom_point"); aes_matches(x="conc", y="uptake")',
  Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'ggplot(CO2, aes(x=conc, y=uptake)) + geom_point()',
  Hint: 'Use the geom_point() layer, and choose the aesthetics x=conc, y=uptake.',
  Output: 'Use ggplot2 to create a scatter plot with the concentration of CO2 ("conc"
    in the data.frame) on the x-axis, and the plant''s CO2 uptake ("uptake" in the
    data frame) on the y axis'}
- {AnswerTests: 'expr_creates_var("fit") && class(fit) == "lm" && length(fit$coefficients)
    == 2 && abs(fit$coefficients[2] - 0.01773059) < 1e-5', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'fit
    = lm(uptake ~ conc, data=CO2)', Hint: Use lm with the formula uptake ~ conc. Don't
    forget to provide "data=CO2" and to save your result in the variable "fit", Output: 'Perform
    a linear regression on the dataset, predicting uptake using CO2 concentration.
    Save it to a variable called "fit"'}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(fit)'), Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: summary(fit),
  Hint: Use the summary function, Output: Display a summary of the linear fit}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="0.017731"), Class: exact_question, CorrectAnswer: 0.017731,
  Hint: 'Give this as a number, not an R expression. You can find this value in the
    second row of the "coefficients" table of the summary output.', Output: 'What
    is the estimate of the slope of the uptake/conc linear relationship?'}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="2.91e-06"), Class: exact_question, CorrectAnswer: 2.91e-06,
  Hint: 'Give this as a number, not an R expression. You can find this value in the
    second row of the "coefficients" table of the summary output.', Output: 'What
    is the p-value of the uptake/conc linear relationship?'}
- {AnswerTests: 'expr_uses_func("geom_point"); expr_uses_func("scale_x_log10"); aes_matches(x="conc",
    y="uptake")', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'ggplot(CO2, aes(x=conc, y=uptake))
    + geom_point() + scale_x_log10()', Hint: Add the scale_x_log10() layer, Output: 'You
    may have noticed in the plot that the concentration ~ uptake relationship is not
    perfectly linear. Try making another scatter plot, but this time put concentration
    (x-axis) on a log scale.'}
- {AnswerTests: 'expr_creates_var("lfit") && class(lfit) == "lm" && length(lfit$coefficients)
    == 2 && abs(lfit$coefficients[2] - 8.484) < 1e-2', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'lfit
    = lm(uptake ~ log(conc), data=CO2)', Hint: 'Perform the same linear fit as before,
    but this time use the formula "uptake ~ log(conc)".', Output: 'While the relationship
    is still not perfectly linear, it does look closer. Try performing another linear
    regression, only this time predict uptake based on "log(conc)" instead of "conc".
    Save it to the variable lfit.'}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(lfit)'), Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: summary(lfit),
  Hint: Use the "summary" function, Output: View a summary of the fit of uptake to
    log(conc).}
- {AnswerChoices: More significant;Less significant, AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="More
    significant"), Class: mult_question, CorrectAnswer: More significant, Hint: Compare
    the p-values between the two fits- the smaller p-value is more significant., Output: 'Did
    the linear relationship become more significant when concentration was placed
    on a log scale, or less significant?'}
