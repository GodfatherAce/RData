- {AnswerTests: 'omnitest(correctExpr=''m = cbind(v1, v2)'')', Class: cmd_question,
  CorrectAnswer: 'm = cbind(v1, v2)', Hint: Use the "cbind" function, Output: 'Earlier
    you created two numeric vectors, v1 and v2, each of length 4. Combine them together
    to make a matrix with 4 rows and two columns, saving it to a variable "m"'}
- {AnswerTests: 'omnitest(correctExpr=''m2 = rbind(m, c(8, 12))'')', Class: cmd_question,
  CorrectAnswer: 'm2 = rbind(m, c(8, 12))', Hint: Use the "rbind" function, Output: 'Add
    a row to the end of your matrix m, with the values 8 and 12, saving it to the
    variable m2'}
- {AnswerTests: 'omnitest(correctExpr=''m2[1:2, ]'')', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'm2[1:2,
    ]', Hint: 'Use square brackets and a comma, putting the indices you want to extract
    in front of the comma', Output: Extract the first two rows of m2}
- {AnswerTests: 'omnitest(correctExpr=''m2[, 2]'')', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'm2[,
    2]', Hint: 'Use square brackets and a comma, putting the indices you want to extract
    after the comma', Output: Extract the second column of m2}
