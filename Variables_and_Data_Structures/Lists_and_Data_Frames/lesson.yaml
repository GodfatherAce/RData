- {AnswerChoices: 'A list can be of any length, while a vector has a maximum size;A
    vector can be of any length, while a list has a maximum size;A list can contain
    values of different data types;A vector can contain values of different data types',
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="A list can contain values of different data types"),
  Class: mult_question, CorrectAnswer: A list can contain values of different data
    types, Hint: TODO, Output: 'How does a list differ from a vector?'}
- {AnswerTests: 'omnitest(correctExpr=''list1 = list(c(1, 3, 4), "test", 4)'')', Class: cmd_question,
  CorrectAnswer: 'list1 = list(c(1, 3, 4), "test", 4)', Hint: Use the "list" function
    to construct a list, Output: 'Create a list, called "list1", containing three
    values- the first one the vector c(1, 3, 4), the second one the character vector
    "test", and the third one the number 4.'}
- {AnswerTests: 'omnitest(correctExpr=''list1[[3]]'')', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'list1[[3]]',
  Hint: 'Use double square brackets ([[3]]), not single', Output: Extract the third
    value from the list list1}
- {AnswerTests: 'omnitest(correctExpr=''list1 = list(a=c(1, 3, 4), b="test", c=4)'')',
  Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'list2 = list(c(1, 3, 4), "test", 4)', Hint: Provide
    the names using "a=..." etc when you are constructing the list, Output: 'Create
    a list, called "list2",  containing three values- the first one the vector c(1,
    3, 4), the second one the character vector "test", and the third one the number
    4, but this time give each of the items names- "a", "b", "c".'}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='list2$c'), Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: list2$c,
  Hint: Use the dollar sign to extract the value from list2, Output: Extract the value
    named "c" from list2 using its name}
