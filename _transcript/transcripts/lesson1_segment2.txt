Segment 2: Variables
------------

The most basic and crucial element of R would be a variable, which could be assigned a single number, a vector, a matrix, a data frame, and others. Technically speaking, variables can be thought of as containers which refer to any type of objects, such as data structures.

Let's first assign numbers or characters to variables. We can simply assign a single number, such as 42, to a variable

This gives the variable `my.number` a value of 42. You can show the value of my.number with a print command

Note that variable names consist of letters, digits, periods and underscores (_), and cannot start with a digit. Do not use other special characters or space in a variable name.

Not all values you could want to store in R are numeric. You could store a string of characters using either single or double quotation marks.

We can print one of these variables

Primitively, R could be used as a scientific calculator. For example, we can add two numbers

and we could assign the result of the calculation to a variable

A math operation could be done using two numeric variables. For instance, we can create another variable `y`

R has many built-in mathematical and statistical functions that are intuitively named and easy to use. You can use exponentiation

or calculate a natural logarithmic value by using a function `log()`
