Segment 6: Logical Vectors and Operators
-------------

Another type of variable is a logical value: `TRUE` or `FALSE`. We can create a logical vector or matrix, as well as using mathematical operations, such as inequalities, on numbers to dynamically generate logical variables.

Using the function `c`, we can make a vector of logical values. Note that TRUE and FALSE are not wrapped by quotation marks.

Note that the class of `y` is "logical"

Note that `TRUE` and `FALSE`, being capitalized, are reserved and treated specially by R. Therefore, you can not and should not name your variable `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

You can compare numeric values in a vector with any value you choose

If you apply a logical operator to a matrix, it will work on each element. Here we ask which elements of `m` are greater than or equal to 5.

However, what if you want "all automatic cars" from the `mtcars` dataset, or "all cars with mpg > 20"? We can first ask R which elements of `mtcars$mpg` is greater than 20

This logical vector can be used to subset rows of the data frame. `TRUE` means "keep the row", `FALSE` means drop it. Place this before the comma in the square brackets

Alternatively, and more concisely, we could also put the expression directly in front of the comma

You can combine multiple conditions using `&` (and) or `|` (or), such as looking for automatic gearshift cars with `mpg` > 20. Here we provide two conditions: that the mpg is greater than 20, and that the gearshift is automatic

Then we can look at the first few rows of `efficient.auto`

We can confirm they have `mpg` greater than 20 and `am` equal to 0.
