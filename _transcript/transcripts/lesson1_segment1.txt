Segment 1: Fundamentals
------------

Hi, my name is Neo Christopher Chung and I am a Ph.D. candidate at Princeton University. Today, I will help you understand the basics of statistical programming in R. R is the de facto standard language for data analysis and development of statistical software. Please make sure that you have already installed R and RStudio on your computer. It will be very important for you to follow each step in R and to make sure you have gotten the correct results.

After opening RStudio, it is essential to set up your working environment. Mainly, we would like to set up the working directory and to remove all objects in the current R session, so we can start fresh. The working directory is a default location on your computer that R is pointing at. If you want to save or load a file, you need to know what the current working directory is.

You can either look right above the console in RStudio, or type in

To organize different R projects and to have a special directory for this R lesson, I created a directory called ``Rlesson`` on my Desktop. Setting the working directory could be done via graphical user interface (in RStudio) or command line interface

If you do not change your working directory, later on you may ended up with a cluttered desktop, lost files, or worse.

We would like know if there are any object in the current R session. In RStudio, we can click on the `Environment` tab to see this list, or simply type

We see that there are three objects, namely test1, test2, and test3. Note that you may see a different list (or an empty list) if there is no object in your current R session.

You may want to delete an object to clear up the working environment. Let's first delete `test1`

If you want to delete every object currently available, you can use `ls()`

Let's make sure all objects have been removed

The `character(0)` means you do not have any objects in the current R session.
