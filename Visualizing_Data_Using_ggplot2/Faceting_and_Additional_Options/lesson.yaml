- {AnswerTests: 'expr_uses_func("geom_point"); expr_uses_func("facet_wrap"); aes_matches(x="price",
    y="depth");', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=price,
    y=depth)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~ cut)', Hint: Add a facet_wrap option,
  Output: 'Create a scatter plot of the diamonds dataset with price on the x axis
    and depth on the y axis, and divide it into facets based on the diamond''s cut'}
- {AnswerTests: 'expr_uses_func("geom_point"); expr_uses_func("facet_grid"); aes_matches(x="price",
    y="depth");', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=depth,
    y=price)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(cut ~ color)', Hint: 'Add a facet_grid option,
    with row ~ column inside.', Output: 'Create a scatter plot of the diamonds dataset
    with depth on the x axis and price on the y axis, and divide it into a facetted
    grid. Let rows in the grid represent different cuts, and let each column represent
    a different color'}
- {AnswerTests: 'omnitest(correctExpr=''ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=depth, y=price)) +
    geom_point() + ggtitle("My Graph") + ylim(0, 10000)'')', Class: cmd_question,
  CorrectAnswer: 'ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=depth, y=price)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("My
    Graph") + ylim(0, 10000)', Hint: Extra options get added on to the end of ggplot
    just like layers., Output: 'Create a scatter plot of the diamonds dataset with
    depth on the x axis and price on the y axis. Give it a title of "My Graph", and
    limit the y axis from 0 to 10000.'}
- {Class: text, Output: 'The Orange data.frame is a dataset that comes built into
    R, which describes the height of five orange trees over time. It has three columns
    "Tree" (a factor describing which of five trees is being measured), "age" (the
    age in days at the point of measurement), and "circumference" (the circumference
    of the tree trunk in millimeters).'}
- {AnswerTests: 'any_of_exprs("data(''Orange'')", ''data("Orange")'', ''data(Orange)'')',
  Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: data("Orange"), Hint: Use the "data" function,
  Output: Load the Orange dataset into memory.}
- {AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(Orange)'), Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: View(Orange),
  Hint: Use the "View" function, Output: View the Orange dataset like a spreadsheet.}
- {AnswerTests: 'omnitest(correctExpr=''ggplot(Orange, aes(x=age, y=circumference))
    + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~ Tree)'')', Class: cmd_question, CorrectAnswer: 'ggplot(Orange,
    aes(x=age, y=circumference)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~ Tree)', Hint: Make
    sure you change the dataset from "diamonds" to "Orange", Output: 'Create a scatter
    plot of the Orange dataset with age on the x-axis and circumference on the y-axis,
    faceted into five sub-plots based on the tree being measured'}
